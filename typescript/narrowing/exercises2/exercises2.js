// 1. typeof Type Guards
// Exercise: Create a function that takes a value as input and returns a string indicating its type (e.g., "number", "string", "boolean", "object", "undefined", "null", "symbol", "bigint"). Use typeof to determine the type.
// 2. Truthiness Narrowing
// Exercise: Write a function that takes a value as input and returns "truthy" or "falsy" based on its truthiness. Use truthiness narrowing to refine the type based on the value.
// 3. Equality Narrowing
// Exercise: Create a function that takes a number as input and returns "even" or "odd". Use equality narrowing to check if the number is divisible by 2.
// 4. The in Operator Narrowing
// Exercise: Define an interface with multiple properties. Write a function that takes an object of that interface as input and returns a string indicating which property is present. Use the in operator to narrow the type based on the property.
// 5. instanceof Narrowing
// Exercise: Create a base class and a derived class. Write a function that takes an object as input and returns a string indicating whether it's an instance of the base class or the derived class. Use instanceof to narrow the type based on the object's class.
// 6. Assignments
// Exercise: Write a function that takes a variable as input and assigns a value to it based on its type. Use type guards to ensure that the value assigned is compatible with the variable's type.
// 7. Control Flow Analysis
// Exercise: Create a function that takes a value as input and returns a string based on its type. Use control flow analysis to ensure that all possible types are handled.
// 8. Using Type Predicates
// Exercise: Define a type predicate that checks if a value is an array of numbers. Use this predicate in a function that calculates the sum of elements in a numeric array.
// 9. Assertion Functions
// Exercise: Create an assertion function that checks if a value is a string. Use this assertion function in a function that converts a string to uppercase.
// 10. Non-null Assertion
// Exercise: Create a function that takes a string as input and returns its length. Use a non-null assertion to ensure that the string is not null or undefined before accessing its length.
// 11. Discriminated Unions
// Exercise: Define a discriminated union of two types with a common property. Write a function that takes an object of the discriminated union as input and returns a string based on the common property.
// 12. The never Type
// Exercise: Create a function that throws an error if a value is of a specific type. Use the never type to indicate that the function never returns.
// 13. Exhaustiveness Checking
// Exercise: Create a function that takes a discriminated union as input and returns a string based on the type. Use exhaustiveness checking to ensure that all possible types are handled.
