1. APIs
  Servers that are created for serving data for external use (in websites or apps) are often referred to as APIs or ‘Application Programming Interfaces’.

  APIs act as the connection (interface or bridge) between clients and servers.

  An API "endpoint" is a specific path (URL) where a client can send requests to access resources from a server.
  Example: GET https://api.example.com/users/123
