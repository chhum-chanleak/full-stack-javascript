// 3. Write the Minimum Code to Pass the Test:
// Write just enough code to make the failing test pass.
// Avoid implementing extra functionality or over-engineering.
export const add = (num1: number, num2: number): number => num1 + num2;

// 4. Refactor the module's implementation code when necessary, then go to the test cases("../tests/tdd.test.ts") and refactor them

// 5. Repeat the Cycle:
// Add a new test for the next piece of functionality.
// Follow the "Fail, Pass, Refactor" cycle for each new test.
